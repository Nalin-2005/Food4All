This directory Will act as our database for this project.
-----------------------------

The 'orders' directory within will contain all orders placed by the donors

The 'ngos' directory will contain the list of all ngos and their email addresses respective to their states

-----------------------------
This method of using directories instead of other good Database Management Systems is to keep it so simple that 
    even if a normal person wants to start developing his/her project using this template, he/she can easily start 
    without having the knowledge of other DBMS/RDBMS like SQL.
