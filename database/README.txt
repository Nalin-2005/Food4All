This directory Will act as our database for this project.
-----------------------------

The 'orders' directory within will contain all orders placed by the donors

The 'ngos' directory will contain the list of all ngos and their email addresses respective to their states

To reset the list of the 'ngos' list, i have provided the 'ngos-orig' folder that contains only my Email Address 
        and name so that i am notified about all activity happening on my website.

-----------------------------
This method of using directories instead of other good Database Management Systems is to keep it so simple that 
    even if a normal person wants to start developing his/her project using this template, he/she can easily start 
    without having the knowledge of other DBMS/RDBMS like SQL.
